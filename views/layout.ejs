<!-- This whole layout.ejs file is a wrapper to the body variable, which means the 'body' variable will be replaced by the other ejs file which will ultimately help us in creating the final rendered page. The purpose of this layout folder is to define a common styles for all the pages. And if some page needs to have a specific style then that page will have its own css files included in the file itself.-->

<!-- Every layout file is known as the wrapper, since it is being used to wrap the different variables using the partials code, the partial code is written in the other file and the other partial code is written in this file itself. -->
